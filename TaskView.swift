import SwiftUI

//Use State and Binding for simple local state. State and Binding are perfect for managing simple state that is local to a view or can be passed from a parent view to a child view. Keep in mind that these property wrappers are designed to work with value types.
//Use ObservedObject and Published for complex state. When you have more complex state that can be shared across multiple views, consider using ObservedObject and Published in combination with a separate state management class.
//Use EnvironmentObject for shared state across unrelated views. If you need to share state across multiple views that arenâ€™t directly related through a parent-child relationship, EnvironmentObject can be a good choice.
//Avoid large State variables. Storing large amounts of data in State variables can lead to performance issues, as SwiftUI recreates your view whenever state changes.
//Defer complex computation and side effects. Avoid running complex computations or side effects, like network requests, directly in your view structures.
